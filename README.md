simple-backup
=============

The hard drive on my Mac mini recently failed.  I was thankful for my 
TimeMaching backups, but I think I'd like to have a simpler solution.
Something where only particular designated folders are backed up.  Changes are
automatically saved and can be restored with the click of a button.

There are lots of backup services out there like Mozy.  But I'd like to try 
writing my own and see how it works and how much it costs compared to these
services.
